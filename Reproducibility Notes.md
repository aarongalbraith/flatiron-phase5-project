# Reproducibility Notes

The notebook for this project can be run by anyone by following these steps:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in any web browser.
2. You will be prompted to "Open notebook". From the selections, click on "GitHub".
3. There will be a prompt to "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" in a search bar. Copy and paste the link for this repository `https://github.com/aarongalbraith/flatiron-phase5-project` and press `return`.
4. Click on what should be the only notebook available, called `notebooks/project_notebook.ipynb`.
5. From the `Runtime` dropdown menu, select `Run all`.

This should run the contents of the notebook and display the same results that are viewable from the static copy in this repository.
